    "The Pearson Correlation Coefficient measures the **linear relationship between two data variables**. \n",
    "- The value of Pearson Correlation Coefficient varies between `-1` and `+1`, with 0 implying no correlation. \n",
    "    - Correlations of `-1` or `+1` imply an exact linear relationship. \n",
    "    - Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. \n",
    "    - Negative correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.\n",

    "Requirements/Assumptions for using the Pearson's correlation coefficient:\n",
