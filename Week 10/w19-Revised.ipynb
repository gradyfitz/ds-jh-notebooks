    "# Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and infer _patterns_ or _trends_ without being explicitly programmed (i.e hardcoding `if` statements). \n",
    "\n",
    "ML Algorithms are often categorized as Supervised or Unsupervised.\n",
    "- Supervised Learning: an approach defined by its use of labeled datasets. These datasets are designed to train or supervise algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time.\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning: an approach which primarily works on unlabeled data sets to _cluster_ or _group_ similar data points together. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we will focus on two Supervised Learning algorithms:\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of other models you have covered in lectures include:\n",
    "- Multiple Linear Regression (Regression based Supervised Learning)\n",
    "- $k$-Nearest Neighbors (Clustering based Unsupervised Learning)\n",
    "- $k$-Means (Clustering based Unsupervised Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "Classification is the task of approximating some mapping function $f$ from input variables $X$ to discrete output variables $y$. In layman's terms:\n",
    "- Given some input $X$ (i.e dataset);\n",
    "- and some function $f$ (i.e a ML model);\n",
    "- output some discrete variable $y$ (i.e a category or classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common example of Classification is the categorizing emails as either _spam_ or _not spam_:\n",
    "- The model is trained with emails that are categorized as _spam_ and also _not spam_.\n",
    "- Given enough data points, the model may learn specific _words_ or _trends_ inside the email which result in an email being _spam_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression (Predictive Modelling)\n",
    "Regression is the task of approximating some mapping function $f$ from input variables $X$ to continuous output variables $y$. In layman's terms:\n",
    "- Given some input $X$ (i.e dataset);\n",
    "- and some function $f$ (i.e a ML model);\n",
    "- output some continuous variable $y$ (i.e a number or numerical value).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of Regression is to predict the price of a _house_ given some features (i.e location, number of rooms, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification and Regression with respect to Project 2\n",
    "- Regression: Predicting the _maximum daily energy usage_ based on the provided weather data (the energy spot price).\n",
    "- Classification: Predicting the _maximum daily price category_ based on the provided weather data (category of usage).\n",
    "\n",
    "I've discussed with Chris regarding the interpretation of the question. Whilst we originally intended for it to be the _maximum value of the day_, we've agreed to also allow the _maximum total usage of the day_ (i.e the cumulative sum of the day). You won't be penalized for using either approach as they are both correct and valid!"

    "## Information Gain (IG)\n",
    "Information Gain (IG) is essentially Mutual Information (MI), but specific to a Feature and Class Label. Like MI, the larger the value, the more _information will be gained_ (hence its called Information Gain). Decision Trees (DT) use IG as a criterion to _split_ features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "- MI is mainly used between two features (let's say Feature A and Feature B).\n",
    "- IG is specifically used between a single feature and class label (let's say Feature A and class label $y$)\n",

    "- $H(y)=-\\sum P(y=y_i)\\log_2(P(y=y_i))$ is the entropy of the class label $y$;\n",
    "- and $H(y|A) = \\sum P(A=a_i)\\log_2(P(y | A=a_i))$ is the conditional entropy of $y$ given $A$\n",

The classification is therefore to predict whether a patient will test positive for diabetes, based on the various measurements.\n"
