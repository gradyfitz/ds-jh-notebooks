    "The real power of a programming language such as Python is its ability to process large amounts of data quickly. In some instances, you want to run code to calculate a single number and can simply print this out, but more likely, you want to process a large amount of data and compute a large number of individual data points. In this case, it often makes sense to save the output of your code to a file. In particular, since any data stored in computer memory is deleted once your programs stops, files provide a means of persistent storage (i.e. storage that persists across time, including when a computer is switched on and off), which you will be able to access later, send to others, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to work with files is very important when dealing with larger datasets, in terms of reading data in from files, and writing data back out to files. As such, file manipulation is often called \"file input/output\" or **file IO**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **file** is a linear sequence of data that is stored on persistent storage such as a hard drive. To process the data in a file, you have to perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the file;\n",
    "2. Read data from a file or write data to a file;\n",
    "3. Close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following analogy might help: to process a document in a drawer, you have to first open the drawer, then process the document (i.e. read it), and finally close the drawer. We will discuss each of the file operations in the following slides.\n"

There is a close analogy with immutable types such as strings, in that you can access the content of the file but not change the original (but can of course create a new file based on the content of the original, as we will come to in a bit).

In append mode, if the file pre-existed, we leave the original content intact and write extra content to the end of the file, and if it didn't pre-exist, it is created first (and append functions identically to write).
