    "The real power of a programming language such as Python is its ability to process large amounts of data quickly. In some instances, you want to run code to calculate a single number and can simply print this out, but more likely, you want to process a large amount of data and compute a large number of individual data points. In this case, it often makes sense to save the output of your code to a file. In particular, since any data stored in computer memory is deleted once your programs stops, files provide a means of persistent storage (i.e. storage that persists across time, including when a computer is switched on and off), which you will be able to access later, send to others, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to work with files is very important when dealing with larger datasets, in terms of reading data in from files, and writing data back out to files. As such, file manipulation is often called \"file input/output\" or **file IO**.\n",

    "2. Read data from a file or write data to a file;\n",

The first line, however, was different to the other lines. It is called the **header row** and provides a textual label for each column of the file. According to the header row, the first column lists the regions of Victoria, and the subsequent columns indicate the number of visitors in each year.
