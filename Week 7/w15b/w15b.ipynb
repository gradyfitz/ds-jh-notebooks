In some instances, you want to run code to calculate a single number and can simply print this out, but more likely, you want to process a large amount of data and compute a large number of individual data points. In this case, it often makes sense to save the output of your code to a file. In particular, since any data stored in computer memory is deleted once your programs stops, files provide a means of persistent storage (i.e. storage that persists across time, including when a computer is switched on and off), which you will be able to access later, send to others, etc.\n\nThe ability to work with files is very important when dealing with larger datasets, in terms of reading data in from files, and writing data back out to files. As such, file manipulation is often called \"file input/output\" or **file IO**.\n\nA **file** is a linear sequence of data that is stored on persistent storage such as a hard drive. To process the data in a file, you have to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Open the file;\n2. Read data from a file or write data to a file;\n3. Close the file.\n\nThe following analogy might help: to process a document in a drawer, you have to first open the drawer, then process the document (i.e. read it), and finally close the drawer. We will discuss each of the file operations in the following slides.\n"], "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": ["# Opening Files"], "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": ["It is necessary to open a file before performing other operations like reading, writing or appending to a file.

By default (without the second argument) the mode is **read only**, meaning you can read the content of the file but not modify it any way. There is a close analogy with immutable types such as strings, in that you can access the content of the file but not change the original (but can of course create a new file based on the content of the original, as we will come to in a bit). In practice, you can stipulate read mode with an `\"r\"`, as in:\n\n```norun;\nfile_object = open(\"quotes.txt\", \"r\")\n```\n\nwhich is identical in functionality to the first call.\n\nThe other two commonly-used modes are **write** (= `\"w\"` as a mode string) and **append** (= `\"a\"` as mode string). With write mode, if the file of that name pre-existed, we delete the original contents when we write to it, and if it didn't pre-exist, it is created first. In append mode, if the file pre-existed, we leave the original content intact and write extra content to the end of the file, and if it didn't pre-exist, it is created first (and append functions identically to write). Both the write and append modes can be combined with the read mode.\n\nWe cover each of these modes in more detail in the following slides, with examples."], "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": ["# Closing Files"], "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": ["Having opened a file, it is good to get into the habit of closing it when you have finished with it, with the `.close()` method:\n\n```\nfile_object = open(\"quotes.txt\")\nfile_object.close()\n```\n\nWhen you close a file, two things happen: (1) all data that has been written/appended to the file is \"flushed\" through to the file, and it is closed on the computer's file system; and (2) the file object associated with the file can no longer be used to manipulate the file.

It is important to free these system resources on completion of the file processing.\n\nThe `.close()` method in Python closes the file and writes the actual data to the disk. It prevents further access to the content of the file until it is opened again.\n\n> ## Function vs. Method\n> The question of whether something should be a function or a method has come up a couple of times already, but there is an interesting asymmetry here, with `open()` being a function and `.close()` a method. Why do you think this is? Would it make sense for `open()` to be a method or `.close()` to be a function?\n>\n> One reason why `.close()` is useful as a method is because it works on a specific file object. This way, there's no need to add any arguments or worry about any errors specifying which file you need to close.
